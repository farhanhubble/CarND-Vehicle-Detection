# Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree: Computer Visison Project - Vehicle Detection
![Vehicle bounding boxes](output.gif)

This repository contains code for Project 5 from the first term of [Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013/). The goal of the project was to detect vehicles in videos, captured by a car camera, using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The code for the entire vehicle detection pipeline is in the file [detect.py](https://github.com/farhanhubble/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/e6d33a9f870b057c3ab46f6587f3fa4d4422504c/detect.py).
